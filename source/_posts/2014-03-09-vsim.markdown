---------------------
This is my first project about Racing. I am a Chinese with bad English, and today is my first time to use English to write a post, Sorry for my bad Engilsh first…

I start my project from last year(2013). I am learning from *[RacingMat](http://www.x-sim.de/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=2248)*, here is his project:[Finished 2DOF 12V DC wiper arduino playseat](http://www.x-sim.de/forum/viewtopic.php?t=943). Thank *[RacingMat](http://www.x-sim.de/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=2248)* very much!  
My project is in progressing, I will update for every detail I finished. 

-------------------------
###Control Part
I am using two 12V DC truck wiper motors, bought in *[taobao](http://www.taobao.com)*;
The controller is *[Arduino Uno](http://www.arduino.cc)*, and the motor driver is *[MotoMonster](http://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=16852136684)*(I don't do any advertising, this is an only one MotoMonster-driver I can find in taobao, I have no choice, so bought this one. Please give me a message if you find anthor driver, my email:*[vell001@qq.com](mailto:vell001@qq.com)*, thanks.

so sad for me. I am just a university student, have nothing can use for my project in my dormitory. So I broke my socket only for a wire, bad idea...but I don't have another idea

All parts of controller are ready, it's time to put all parts together.

###Seat Part
 Yesterday, I bought 12m steel cube. Today I want to get a second-hand *cardan*. 

2014/3/9 13:24:57

------------
I was not so lucky, I didn't find a *street scrap*. I asked a hostess of a garage for a new cardan, her price was so higher than my price that I expected. Then, I went back, and bought in taobao.

> ![items](/images/20140309173426.png)

> The cardan's size is 20\*32\*85 mm; and zhe *joint bearing* is M5 internal thread.

------------
I still need some screws, some rebar, and a seat; Most importent thing is an *electric welding machine*! Good Luck to myself...

Yesterday, I had finish *Steel Skeleton* of my simulator, I'll put some picture here later.
I am so unlucky today. In the morning, I tried to fix my two motor on the *bottom support*, but I have failed. In the afternoon, I fixed my two motor and two *Support Bar*, I just want to conect all the controller part and adjust some detail, but something wrong with my *Driver-Broad*, when I turn on power support,   before long, I smelled a burning smell, I saw a *Audion* just had burned on the driver board. Then, I could adjust one potentiometer and all motor run. Bad luck!!! I'll buy a new driver for my two motors

--------------
I received my new *MotorDriver* today, I will forget *MotoMonster-Driver*
> ![MotorDriver](/images/20140318182635.jpg)

> Look good, I'll test it tomorrow

I rewrited all codes and redesigned wiring diagram, I'll put my codes here later, here is my own diagram:
> [![diagram](/images/20140318221922.png)](/images/vsim_wiring_diagram.jpg)

> designed with *Photoshop*

2014/3/18 22:16:05 

----------------
I used *MonsterDriver* back, because the new driver have a big flaw. When my arduino poweroff or reboot, the driver's *PWM* pin will read some wrong data, and supply power to my motor, then it's will damage all my design.

I'll talk about some details later. I want to put my test video here now:

2014/3/21 23:37:42 

---------------
Today is a dark day for me. My *MonsterDriver* was completely broken! Bad Luck~ It's my mistake, last time I found my motor's power wire is connected to it's shell. When I powered *MonsterDriver* on, just like *ShortCircuit*, my *MonsterDriver* was burned(not completely broken). And then I thinked I had solved this problem, I fixed my motor on a *wood board*. I was too careless, I didn't notice that my two motor connected together through the upper frame!!!This time my *MonsterDriver* was completely broken! I don't know why that my *MonsterDriver* only supply a positive voltage, in other words, the motor only can go forward. Very Very Sad!!! I must be more careful in future.  

Some good news, I got a second hand seat, and finished all installations of the upper frame, In other words, my simulator just leaves the matter of the *motor driver* module.

---------------------
Last sunday, I finished my *VSIM* project. It's amazing for me, although looks a bit ugly. This is my test video:

I am using my third *MotorDriver*, I am busy now, I'll update more detail later

Today I want to update some detail of this project. I have finished this project about a month ago.
